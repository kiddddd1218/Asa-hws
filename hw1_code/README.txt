This ipynb file simulates the Weak Law of Large Numbers, the Central Limit Theorem, and the concentration inequality. Once you open this notebook correctly, you should see 5 cells. To use it, you need to:

1. First run the first cell to install everything for this notebook and define i.i.d. generators.
2. Choose any section you like and run it to get the corresponding result.
3. In each section, you can change # of samples and # of experiments to simulate different situations.
4. You can add a new i.i.d. generator by defining iid_{name} = lambda n:nr.{distribution u want to use, see https://numpy.org/doc/1.16/reference/routines.random.html}(n) and replace current generators in each section.
